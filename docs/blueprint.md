## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant crisp gold (#D4AF37), is used throughout the app as the primary color. It is important that this color is bold.
- Background color: A desaturated black (#16181a), complements the blue tones, is used to achieve the look that was asked for. The original request specified for it to look techy so it important that contrast is achieved between foreground elements. 
- Accent color: The color #3F98C1, an analogous yet more eye catching blue that accents the bold primary to tie elements of the app together.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif, fits the request for the new website to look more high tech
- Body font: 'Inter', a more utilitarian font used in combination with the Space Grotesk font above, balances and harmonizes visual content in the design.
- Use sharp, vector-based icons that align with the 'techie' aesthetic; the design should utilize icons representing software, AI, and digital solutions.
- Modern grid layout with a focus on a modular design; ensure the site is fully responsive, adjusting smoothly across various devices and screen sizes.
- Subtle animations and transitions (e.g., fade-ins, smooth scrolling) to enhance user experience without being intrusive.
